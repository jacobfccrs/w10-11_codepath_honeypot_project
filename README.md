# w10-11_codepath_honeypot_project


Setting up a honepot and intercepting attempted attacks using Modern Honey Network.

<hr>

## Objective
From the codepath page:

> In this assignment, you will stand up a basic honeypot and demonstrate its effectiveness at detecting and/or collecting data about an attack. 
<hr>

Codepath gave instructions on how to set-up and deploy a honeypot. the same instructions also work to deploy more honeypots of my choice. 

### Honeypots Deployed

* Dionaea
* snort
* suricata


### hours spent:
  About 10 hrs


<hr>


<b><h3>Issues Encountered</h3></b>
* Though the instructions were easy to follow, I coiuld not get the MHN server to show some of the icons. Could be that I missed a command. Deploying a honeypot was no a problem whatsoever and setting up the other two was straight forward.

* Downloading the .json file was a bit complicated, not sure if it was becasue I'm using Windows for this project, or I was running the commands from the worng instance. I needed more instructions and how to troubleshoot some errors.

### Notes

For about half an hour I did not know where to start.
However, the instructions for week 8 gave me an idea on where to begin, and reminded me on the attacks.  
The easiest exploit I found was enumeration, since the first step I took was to look at login errors, hoping I could get some 
errors that could lead me to SQLi.
